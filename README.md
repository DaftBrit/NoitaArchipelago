# Noita Archipelago
A Noita mod to provide support for the Archipelago multiworld platform

Early stages, currently only cosmetic, hijacks chest functionality and has a settings screen

Planned functionality
 - Chests are considered a check, all other items and pools are unaffected
 - Ability to set chest spawn rate from vanilla to "lots"
 - Similar implemtation to ROR2, no end goals just a check count 
 - Items going into the pool that can be recieved from a check (from local or remote multiworlds)
    - GOOD:
      - Full Heal
      - Spell Refresh
      - Gold
      - Random wand (Tierd by rareity)
      - Max Health increase (Scarce)
    - BAD:
      - Bombs
      - Enemy spawns
      - Material Swaps
      - Look to the twitch integrations mods for additional inspiration
